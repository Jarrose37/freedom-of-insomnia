# freedom-of-insomnia
Completely server-side mod for Fabric that allows players to disable phantom spawning (doInsomnia) individually. This means that one player can farm phantom membranes on a server while another player can live their life unbothered by them.

Usage: /insomnia <enable|disable|status>
